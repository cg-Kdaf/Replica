# Replica
---
This project is about creating a user interface where everything is connected. The user can see his calendar, his contacts.
The idea was to create a complete workspace as a Replica of the real life : putting all services in a single database and make relations between all infos.
This would allow the user to know where he did an activity, with who he rode, or when he sent a message to Toto.

It is implemented as a webpage, so the user can see his infos from all around the world.
I used python, flask, sqlite3 and standard html css for this little project.

This project made me realize the interconnections behind the use of different APIs and frameworks. This was a great learning experience, which I'll maybe continue.
